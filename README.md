## CSS Techniques Used 

1. **Flexbox**: 

2. **Media Queries**: Two breakpoints were defined at 576px and 400px.

3. **Transitions**:  The burger increases its size slightly when hovered over.

4. **Percentage Widths**: To ensure the responsiveness of the burger

## Additional Notes

1. The HTML structure of the burger is very flexible. You can easily add, remove, or change the order of the burger components by modifying the HTML. 

## Considerations

While the project met the criteria defined, it can be further enhanced in various ways. For instance, JavaScript can be incorporated to enable more interactive features, 
like adding or removing burger components dynamically. Further refinements can also be made to the aesthetics of the design.
